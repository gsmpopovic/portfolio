                  <h2 class='em'>My interests</h2>
                  <p> As a developer with a background in Classical Languages and Philosophy, 
                     I'm very interested in their intersection, the "digital humanities", 
                     and how web technologies and procedures can be used to display, 
                     interact with, and shed new light on the study of classical and philosophical texts.</p>
