                  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                  <p>I'm an aspiring web developer from NYC, and my work is done through the WAMP stack 
                     (PHP is my backend language, and I'd love to learn Python).

                  <h2>My background</h2>
                  <p>I have a BA in Classical Languages and Philosophy from Fordham University (2019), and have been interested in web development and programming in general since June of 2018.</p>

                  <h2>My interests</h2>
                  <p> As a developer with a background in Classical Languages and Philosophy, 
                     I'm very interested in their intersection, the "digital humanities", 
                     and how web technologies and procedures can be used to display, 
                     interact with, and shed new light on the study of classical and philosophical texts.
